Disclaimer:
We have not changed or modified the pibridge.dll.
You can check the file integrity by comparing this file with original pibridge.dll
We just made a batch file to register the dll to make it work with Excel.
The batch file is open and you can see the cmd's of the batch file with notepad.
The sample excel sheet also open and you can see the VBA code used to place order.
Nothing is hidden :)
